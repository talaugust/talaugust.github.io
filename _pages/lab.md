If you are interested in working with me, instead of emailing me please fill out [this interest survey](https://forms.gle/5h8HPEsdm6DBsLwy9). This is the best way of getting in touch with me.




<!-- **Ph.D. applicants**: I will be taking new students in Fall 2024! If you are interested in HCI, NLP, communication, or reading and writing tools, I encourage you to apply for a PhD at the [UIUC Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/degree-program-options) and mention me in your application. 

I love working with motivated students at the intersection of HCI and NLP. My focus is on human-centered problems and so I predominantly contribute to HCI research. I also often contribute to NLP research because my work uses computational methods to quantify and adapt language. Working in my group will always include a focus on a human problem, whether we are running experiments, building new interfaces, or training new models. Some examples of ongoing projects and future plans: 

- Making [medical](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589955) and [scientific language](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.569/) readable for people beyond doctors and researchers
- Building [technologies](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-srw.10.pdf) to support languages beyond English 
- Helping online communities welcome [new members](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376524)
- Studying what barriers people face when reading legal language  -->
