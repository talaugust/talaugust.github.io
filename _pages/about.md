I am a Young Investigator (postdoc) at the [Allen Institute for AI]("https://allenai.org/") on the Semantic Scholar team and an incoming assistant professor at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]("https://cs.illinois.edu/), starting Fall 2024. I recently finished my PhD at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Katharina Reinecke](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/) and [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I study ways to adapt language styles to different people and I build tools to make language adaptation automatic. I refer to this work as [language as design](assets/pdf/AugustDissertation.pdf) because I see language as the ubiquitous interface we use to communicate and my work as finding new ways of designing language better for different people. The long term goal of my research is to improve our communication with one another and with technology.

<!-- Originally intending a Cognitive Science major, but finding myself in a different 'CS' discipline, I've been drawn to my current work through a mixture of Psychology, Design and HCI research at Tufts University, where I worked with Professors <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/" target="_blank"> Rob Jacob</a>,<a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/" target="_blank"> Remco Chang</a>, <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/people/thomas/" target="_blank">Ayanna Thomas</a>, and<a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/ronald-lasser" target="_blank"> Ron Lasser</a>.  -->
