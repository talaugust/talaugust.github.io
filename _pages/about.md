I am an assistant professor at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). 

The overarching goal of my research is to create human-centric artificial intelligence (AI) systems that reduce inequalities in knowledge access. I pursue this goal by (1) evaluating AI systems' ability to communicate specialized knowledge to different people (e.g., explaining a contract clause to people with different education levels) and (2) building interactive and intelligent systems to augment people's ability to read, write, and listen in knowledge intensive settings like medicine, law, and science. 

I previously was a Young Investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/). I received my PhD at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Katharina Reinecke](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/) and [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/).

#### Interested in working with me? 

If you are interested in working with me, instead of emailing me please fill out [this interest survey](https://forms.gle/5h8HPEsdm6DBsLwy9). As much as I would like to, I rarely have time to respond to emails from prospective students. The interest form is the best way of getting in touch with me.


**Ph.D. student applicants**: I do not plan to recruit any new students for Fall 2026.





<!-- Originally intending a Cognitive Science major, but finding myself in a different 'CS' discipline, I've been drawn to my current work through a mixture of Psychology, Design and HCI research at Tufts University, where I worked with Professors <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/" target="_blank"> Rob Jacob</a>,<a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/" target="_blank"> Remco Chang</a>, <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/people/thomas/" target="_blank">Ayanna Thomas</a>, and<a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/ronald-lasser" target="_blank"> Ron Lasser</a>.  -->
