Hello! I am a Young Investigator (postdoc) at the [Allen Institue for AI]("https://allenai.org/") on the Semantic Scholar team. I am also an incoming assistant professor at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]("https://cs.illinois.edu/), starting Fall 2024. I recently finished my PhD at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Katharina Reinecke](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/) and [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I study ways of making language more approachable to different readers, and I build reading tools to make this flexbility automatic. I refer to this work as [language as design](assets/pdf/AugustDissertation.pdf). I am currently building reading tools to make scientific language more approachable, such as by automatically identifying writing strategies used in science blogs and articles to engage different audiences. In the past I have also examined how language styles (e.g., formality vs. informality, types of framing) influence user behavior in online experiments. I explored these effects of language style through online studies on [LabintheWild](http://labinthewild.org/).

My CV: [PDF](assets/pdf/August_CV.pdf).

<!-- Originally intending a Cognitive Science major, but finding myself in a different 'CS' discipline, I've been drawn to my current work through a mixture of Psychology, Design and HCI research at Tufts University, where I worked with Professors <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/" target="_blank"> Rob Jacob</a>,<a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/" target="_blank"> Remco Chang</a>, <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/people/thomas/" target="_blank">Ayanna Thomas</a>, and<a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/ronald-lasser" target="_blank"> Ron Lasser</a>.  -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
