I am an assistant professor at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I study how to adapt language to different audiences, with a focus on knowledge intensive domains like science, health and legal communication. I conduct empirical analyses to study how changes in language will affect different audiences, and I build intelligent reading and writing systems for augmenting our language in new ways. The long term goal of my research is to improve our communication with---and understanding of---one another through technology. 


I previously was a Young Investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/). I received my PhD at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Katharina Reinecke](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/) and [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/).

<!-- Originally intending a Cognitive Science major, but finding myself in a different 'CS' discipline, I've been drawn to my current work through a mixture of Psychology, Design and HCI research at Tufts University, where I worked with Professors <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/" target="_blank"> Rob Jacob</a>,<a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/" target="_blank"> Remco Chang</a>, <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/people/thomas/" target="_blank">Ayanna Thomas</a>, and<a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/ronald-lasser" target="_blank"> Ron Lasser</a>.  -->
