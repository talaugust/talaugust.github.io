# CS598: Language, Interfaces, and Communication
This graduate special topics course covers recent advances in computing for augmenting human language. We will cover foundational sociolinguistic theories of communication and investigate new advances in HCI, NLP, and AI that aim to improve how we communicate with one another through language. We will learn how to identify when language will impact behavior through empirical studies, and how to design, build and evaluate intelligent communication tools.
