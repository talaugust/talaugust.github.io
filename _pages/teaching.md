# CS598: Language, Interfaces, and Communication
This graduate special topics course covers recent advances in computing for augmenting human language. We will cover foundational sociolinguistic theories of communication and investigate new advances in HCI, NLP, and AI that aim to improve how we communicate with one another through language. We will learn how to identify when language will impact behavior through empirical studies, and how to design, build and evaluate intelligent communication tools.

# CS498: Human-Language Model Interaction
This undergraduate special topics course explores emerging topics in HCI and NLP research to uncover what it means for language technologies, specifically LMs, to be human centered. We will start with foundational research on human-centered design and how this work has been integrated into model development and evaluation. We will learn how ideas in HCI and NLP are intersecting in new and interesting ways, and try our hands at developing some of our own novel language interactions. Classes are a mix of lectures and discussionbs, with many class activities planned.
